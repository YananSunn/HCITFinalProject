Actually the solution is very simple

Just need to change the profile in mixed Reality toolkit (in the hierarchy window) to NUIX-Studio profile 

I hope it is going to work

But still eye tracking won't be supported 

HandTracking will be supported though

For each of the mrtk examples, you only need to change the camera profile in mrtk examples to OpenXRSDKConfiguration camera profile or NUIX-Studio camera profile, to make it move together with your head 

Sorry that I still haven't provided the example of speech recognition, unexpectedly was asked to perform corrections in my thesis before the ddl today at 8pm. Bur as soon as I finish, will start implementing it 

Yeah so this was the team I talked about

They send the data over tcp and parse it inside oculus, without any openhab integration

*Send the recognized text

A bit difficult implementation, but I gonna ask them to share it

This is a video tutorial

There is one problem

Android App requires Google app for speech recognition, but I guess your devices don't have it

Another solution is using Homekit on your Apple devices, but voice control will be performed something like:

Set sensor name to <your voice command>

Can only wrap the command like this, that's Homekit limitations. Basically, the voice command will be treated as one of the iot devices in your smart home

I have also installed speech recognition package on Oculus, but it is outdated and, again, relies on Google speech recognition

Maybe using Azure services on your computer is the best solution, I got the source code and can create a tutorial for you

https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/quickstart/csharp/unity/from-microphone

Just used this tutorial, included the speech recognition asset. 

I will also create a demo scene in the next commit to NUIX-Studio with my api key for speech recognition included, please don't share this key to others:)
