At present, with the development of the information technologies and the internet, people are in the information explosion era. We can know the news and emergencies around the world in several seconds. 

News is increasingly becoming an indispensable part of people's daily life. Some people pay attention to entertainment news, others focus on current political news, and also, some care about financial news. So, how to make it easier for people to get access to news is my proposal topic.



## Application Scenarios

### Jogging

When people are jogging, they are kind of leisure. So they may want to make full use of their time and utilize this time to get some news. 

**Interaction design**

devices: phone, smart bracelet and  headset

reasons: Since people need to pay attention to the traffic and enviroment, a good interaction method during jogging must be eye-free. So listening to the news is the best choice.

steps: People can select several categories, in which they have interest, before they start jogging. When they are jogging, they can use the shortcuts in the smart bracelet or the headset to "Skip current news", "Pause the news", "Adjust the volume" and so on. Compared to interact with the phone, these interactions are easier.

extra features(only some ideas as extension): Adjust the volume intelligently according to the ambient sound. When there is a sharper sound, such as a car horn, it will pause automatically.



### In the car

Nowadays, the average commuting time in many big cities is more than one hour, which makes it possible and important for people to get news in the car.

**Interaction design**

devices: car audio and display screen

reasons: When there is a traffic jam, the driver may need to wait for several minutes, which is a good chance for them to get news.

steps: When the car stops, the drivers can watch some video news via the display screen. But when the car starts moving, the screen must be shut down and the drivers can only listen to the news.



### Breaking news

News is happening all the time, but people can't keep an eye on it all the time. But when some news that users are very interested in happens, they may want to know it immediately. 

devices: smart bracelet

reasons: A good news application needs to let users know the news that they care about quickly without disturbing others.

steps: People can set several categories as their concerns. When some breaking news in these categories happens, their smart bracelet will vibrate two times and show the abstract(less then 6 words) to let the user have a general understanding.
